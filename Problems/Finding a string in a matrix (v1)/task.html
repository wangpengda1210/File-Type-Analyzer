<h2>Finding a string in a matrix (v1)</h2>

  <p>The basic version of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm allows finding all occurrences of one string in another. Along with this version, there exist some modifications that can be used to solve more sophisticated problems. One of them allows finding a string in another string represented as a matrix. In this task, you need to implement this modification of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input</strong>: the first line contains a pattern $p$. The second line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $m$. The rest of the lines represent a matrix $t$: $n$ rows each containing $m$ characters.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output</strong>: the first line should contain one integer $k$: the number of times the patter $p$ occurs in the matrix $t$. Each of the next $k$ lines should contain a pair of indexes where $p$ occurs in $t$. The first element of each pair should correspond to a row, the second one should be a column. The pairs should be sorted in ascending order (see the example below for details).</p> 
  <p>Assume, for example, that we want to find a pattern $p$ = "baac" in the below matrix:</p> 
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/4ab7ca2c-343f-473b-9542-2a2035bbb45f/"></p> 
  <p>As you can see, the pattern appears in the matrix twice: the first time at the index (0, 1), the second one at (2, 3). Note that although the second occurrence is split into two rows, it is still considered as an occurrence. Hence, the output should be:</p> 
  <pre><code class="java">2
0 1
2 3</code></pre> 
  <p>Keep in mind that all occurrences should be sorted by their row index first, and then by column index in case the firsts match. </p>
